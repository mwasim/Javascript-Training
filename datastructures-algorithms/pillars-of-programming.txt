Which code is the best?

1. READABLE
    Should be readable to others.

2. Speed
    Should have efficient time-complexity.

3. Memory
    We've limited memory. We use Big O to talk about SPACE COMPLEXITY.

Most programming code solutions have tradeoff between speed and memory.
    You want to go fast, you might have to sacrifice more memory.
    You want less memory, you might want to have less speed. 

Heap & Stack:
    When a program executes, it has two ways to remember things.
        Heap: Usually where we store variables.
        Stack: Where we keep track of our function calls.

SPACE COMPLEXITY:
    Talking about Space Complexity (Memory) is very similar to talking about the Time Cost.
    - We simply look at the size of the input, and see how many new variables or new memory we're allocating. 
    - How much memory is being used.
    - What causes Space complexity?-
        Adding Variables
        Adding Data Structures
        Function Call
        Allocations
