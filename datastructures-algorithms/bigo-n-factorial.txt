Big O = O(n!) = FACTORIAL TIME.
    It means that we're adding a nested loop for every input. It sounds pretty terrible, doesn't ?
    It's the most expensive of all, and it's the steepest of them all. This is called Factorial Time.

    If you've any code with this Big O notation, you're definitely doing something wrong.
