RULE BOOK:

RULE-1: Worst Case
    RULE-2: Remove Constants
        RULE-3: Different terms for Inputs
            RULE-4: Drop Non Dominants


Explanation:
RULE-1: Worst Case:
    When calculating Big O, we always think about the worst case.
    EXAMPLE: 
    In findNemo example, let's say loop executes 10 times to find nemo, but nemo is found on 4th iteration, and we exist the loop. 
    Still, in the worst case, nemo could be the last item (10th item).

RULE-2: Remove Constants:
        When calculating Big O, we drop constants.
    Example:
        If a function as Big O = O(1 + n/2 + 100)
         Based on this Rule, we remove/drop constants, so it becomes
        O(n/2 + 1) 
        As n gets larger and larger, dividing by 2 has significanly descreasingly significant
        So, it becomes O(n)
        
        Other examples:
        - O(a + 5000000) becomes O(a) [simply drop constants]


RULE-3: Different terms for Inputs
    This is the trickiest part of the interview that lot of people make mistakes on. But once, you understand it, it becomes really easy to spot.
    EXAMPLE:
    With different terms as parameters (inputs e.g. a, b),
    most people, will still say, it's Big O = O(n), but it's INCORRECT.

    Because 3rd Rule says different terms for inputs!
    In this example, 
        boxes input => can be 100 items
        boxes2 input => can be just 1 item,
        So, Big O for this example = O(a + b) OR O(n + m) OR O(boxes1 + boxes2)


RULE-4: Drop Non Dominants (Or Drop Non Dominant Terms)
    EXAMPLE-1:
        Let's say a function has Big O = O(n + n^2)
        But by Rule#4 - We need to Drop Non Dominant Terms, it means we care about the most important term
        So, here we drop the first 'n' in expression O(n + n^2), so it becomes O(n^2)
        Big O = O(n^2)

    EXAMPLE-2:
        Let's say we've a function with 
            Big O = O(x^2 + 3x + 1000 + x / 2)
            Here, value for x can be anything e.g. 5, 5000, 10,000 etc.
            By putting the bigger values in place of X, we see x^2 is the DOMINANT term, 
            And the other terms can be dropped.
        By droping the non dominating terms we've,
            Big O = O(x^2)
