Which code is the best?

1. READABLE
    Should be readable to others.

2. Speed
    Should have efficient time-complexity.

3. Memory
    We've limited memory. We use Big O to talk about SPACE COMPLEXITY.

Most programming code solutions have tradeoff between speed and memory.
    You want to go fast, you might have to sacrifice more memory.
    You want less memory, you might want to have less speed.
