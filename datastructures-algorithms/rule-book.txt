Explanation:
RULE-1: Worst Case:
    When calculating Big O, we always think about the worst case.
    EXAMPLE: 
    In findNemo example, let's say loop executes 10 times to find nemo, but nemo is found on 4th iteration, and we exist the loop. 
    Still, in the worst case, nemo could be the last item (10th item).
